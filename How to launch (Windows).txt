How to launch (Windows)

Recommended (uses launch.bat):
1. Ensure Node.js is installed (includes npx). Check with:
   - node --version
   - npx --version

2. Double-click launch.bat in the project folder (or run it from a Command Prompt):
   - The script will try to run: npx http-server -p 8000 -a 127.0.0.1
   - If npx is found it will open your default browser at: http://127.0.0.1:8000
   - If npx is not found the script will open index.html directly (may fail for ES modules).

Manual start (if you prefer):
- Open a Command Prompt in the project folder and run:
  npx http-server -p 8000 -a 127.0.0.1
- Then open: http://127.0.0.1:8000

Alternative (no server):
- Double-click index.html (may work for simple pages, but ES modules often require a local server).

Troubleshooting
- "Unable to connect" in the browser:
  - Confirm the server window started and shows http-server logs.
  - Try http://127.0.0.1:8000 instead of http://localhost:8000.
  - Run from a terminal so you can see errors: open cmd → cd to the folder → launch.bat
  - Check npx availability: npx --version
  - Check the port is listening: netstat -an | find "8000"
  - Try another browser (Firefox proxy/settings can block local connections).
  - Temporarily allow the process through Windows Firewall/AV.

- If the server fails to start:
  - Copy any error text from the server window and share it for diagnosis.
  - Ensure you are in the project folder (index.html, script.js, style.css and assets present).

Notes
- Keep index.html, style.css, script.js and assets in the same folder as launch.bat.
- A local server is recommended if your app uses type="module" or fetches local files.
- If you want a single-file version (no server needed) ask for a merged index.html and I can create it.
